5. CHALLENGES FACED AND SOLUTIONS IMPLEMENTED :
   
I. DESIGNING A FUNCTIONAL INTERFACE
The poor user interface design of your app might directly lead to a high 
abandonment rate, lower retention rate, and a low conversion rate as well. A 
user’s first impression of an app is largely determined by its design guidelines 
and how easy the mobile app is to use. 
Solutions Implemented : By Adding as many features into the app as 
possible, hoping to create an “all-in-one” app with an intuitive and easy-to-use 
interface, users have no problem finding and learning how to use the app’s 
various features,
II. CROSS-PLATFORM APP DEVELOPMENT
There are numerous issues with cross-platform development. Firstly, there is a 
huge dependency on the type of framework that is used to develop the app.
o Different browsers may interpret JavaScript and CSS differently, leading 
to compatibility issues.
Solutions Implemented :
o By testing the app on multiple browsers and versions to ensure crossbrowser compatibility. Using feature detection and polyfills when 
necessary.
o And developed using standard forms of coding, like Javascript and CSS 
that have higher performance.
III. STORAGE LIMITATIONS :
Local Storage is a property that allows JavaScript sites and apps to save key-value 
pairs in a web browser with no expiration date. This means the data stored 
persists even after the user closes the browser or restarts the computer.
o Local storage has size limitations (usually around 5-10 MB), which can 
become a constraint if the user accumulates a large number of tasks.
Solutions Implemented :
o Covered how to save, retrieve, and delete items in local Storage.
o By Implementing data pagination, which loads only a subset of tasks at a 
time. Consider using alternative storage solutions, such as IndexedDB, for 
larger datasets.



6. LEARNING OUTCOMES : 
 
• JAVASCRIPT PROFICIENCY:
o Developing strong JavaScript skills for adding interactivity, handling user 
input, and implementing dynamic features.
o Cultivation of a mindset for continuous learning in the rapidly evolving 
JavaScript ecosystem.
o Storing and retrieving data from local storage, managing data 
serialization/deserialization, and handle potential errors related to local 
storage operations.
• LOCAL STORAGE USAGE:
o Understanding, How to use local storage to persistently store and 
retrieve data on the client side.
o Developing testing strategies to ensure that data is correctly stored, 
retrieved, and manipulated in local storage. 
o Understanding the limitations of local storage in terms of capacity.
• EVENT HANDLING : 
o Learnt, How the Event handlers can be used to handle and verify 
user input, user actions, and browser actions
o Things that should be done every time a page loads. Things that 
should be done when the page is closed. Action that should be 
performed when a user clicks a button



7. PROJECT UPDATE : Given Task-3 Is Successfully Completed.
   
The TO-DO App successfully meets its objective of providing users with a 
streamlined task management experience. The integration of local storage 
ensures that users can manage their tasks persistently, fostering a seamless and 
efficient workflow. The app can serve as a foundation for future enhancements 
and additional features to further enhance the user experience and productivity
